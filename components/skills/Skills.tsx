              During my university coursework in software engineering, I
              explored diverse technologies and frameworks. These valuable tools
              have served as trusty allies, empowering me to craft both academic
              and personal projects.

              My skills revolve mainly around web development. Here, I mainly
              use languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python. Iâ€™ve
              also developed my skills using frontend frameworks like React.js
              and Next.js, while also immersing myself in backend technologies
              like Spring Boot, Express.js and FastAPI. Moreover, I possess some
              experience working with databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

              But my skills are not limited to the web. I am also able to create
              engaging mobile applications with React Native, where I blend
              functionality and aesthetics with ease. Furthermore, While I have
              prior experience with machine learning, I am continually expanding
              my knowledge and honing my skills in this domain.
