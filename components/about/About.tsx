                                Hey there! I'm Ghaith Mlika, and I hail from Tunisia.
                                I've just wrapped up my studies in Computer Science at "
                                Ã‰cole Polytechnique de Sousse ", with a focus on software engineering.

                                During my time there, I dived deep into all things tech.
                                From coding challenges to exploring the ins
                                and outs of data structures and algorithms,
                                I've had my fair share of late-night coding sessions! Beyond the code,
                                I've also learned a lot about different
                                software development technologies,
                                giving me a well-rounded view of the tech landscape.

                                But hey, it's not all about the textbooks!
                                I'm genuinely passionate about finding solutions
                                to real-world problems.
                                As I step into the exciting world of tech, I'm pumped to bring
                                my skills to the table. I'm all about teamwork,
                                learning from others, and pushing boundaries.
