# Next.js Personal Portfolio 

## Getting Started

Welcome to my Next.js portfolio! 
This project showcases my skills and projects 
using various technologies 
such as TypeScript, Framer Motion, Three.js, and EmailJS. 
The Three.js library is specifically utilized to create an interactive 
3D object representing a laptop.

## Features
- TypeScript: Enhanced type-checking and better code quality. 
- Framer Motion: For smooth animations and transitions across components. 
- Three.js: Used to render an interactive 3D laptop object, enhancing user experience. 
- EmailJS: Integration for sending emails directly from the contact form.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mlika-Gaith/nextjs-personal-portfolio.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
    cd your-nextjs-portfolio-directory
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
```

4. **Run the development server:**

```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
```

## Note
Don't forget to set up your **.env.local** or **.env** file with the following
env variables to use email.js contact form to send emails:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_SERVICE_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_PUBLIC_KEY=
```
you can see the **.env.example** file.

## Usage
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- Explore the portfolio to view my projects, skills, and experience. 
- Interact with the 3D laptop object rendered using Three.js in the hero section. 
- Use the contact form to send emails directly through EmailJS integration.
